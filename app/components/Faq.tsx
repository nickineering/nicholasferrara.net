      <h3>Are you open to new roles?</h3>

        What is your preferred industry, tech stack, working pattern, company
        size, office mug colour etc?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I&apos;m primarily motivated by continuously learning to solve real
        problems in a strong, supportive culture that attracts like minded
        driven individuals. The exact way I would like to solve those problems
        will depend on the business situation and in fact I prefer a bit of
        variety when I can get it. I prefer to avoid excessive meetings or
        anything else that distracts from the core problems I was hired to
        solve, though.
